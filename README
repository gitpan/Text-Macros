This is the Text::Macros module -- by John Porter, jdporter@min.net

It is a class for implementing macros in text "templates". 

Macros are sections of text which are to be replaced by the result
of some function call.  Such sections are set off (delimited) from
the rest of the text by special delimiter strings.
Examples of delimiter pairs (opening and closing):

	##		##
	{{		}}
	[[		]]
	<!--		-->
	<macro-		>
	macro(		)
	BEGIN-MACRO	END-MACRO

And so on.
For more specific information, please see the documentation inside
Macros.pm.  This can be done by typing

	pod2text Macros.pm

before installation, or 

	perldoc Text::Macros

after installation.

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

__END__
